			<p>Great value for money, decent hotel
If you have business meetings in downtown London, and want a walking distance hotel - an unbeatable deal. I took the double room with toilet, and still paid a surprisingly low sum, including breakfast and internet connectivity. The only minus I had was the fact there was no elevator, but given the great price, its well worth it

<p>“Great BnB in London”
I had a great experience during my stay at Gloucester Palace Hotel. The location it self is great, walking distance to Baker Street underground, Madame Tussaud musseum, Oxford Road and just one block away from shops, restaurants, post office, cafe. The staffs on front desk very helpful. They always gave me the best information about direction, train and so on.
